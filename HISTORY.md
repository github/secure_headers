0.3.0
=======
- Greatly reduce the need to use the forward_endpoint attribute. If you are posting from your site to a host that matches TLD+1 (e.g. translate.twitter.com matches twitter.com), use a protocol relative value for report-uri. This will alleviate the need to use forwarding. If your host doesn't match, you still need to use forwarding due to host mismatches for Firefox.

0.2.3
=======

- Fix error in report-uri logic for Firefox forwarding.

0.2.2
=======

- Stop applying chrome-extension: to Firefox directives.

0.2.1
=======

- Firefox headers will now stop overriding report_uri when only a path is supplied

0.2.0
=======

- 0.1.0 introduced a serious regression in which child controllers overwrote parent controller config values
- Decoupling of CSP headers and the request object. Allows you to generate static values to save cycles:

```ruby
FIREFOX = SecureHeaders::ContentSecurityPolicy.new(config, :ua => "Firefox", :ssl => true).value
CHROME = SecureHeaders::ContentSecurityPolicy.new(config, :ua => "Chrome", :ssl => true).value
```
- :forward_endpoint now acts as the endpoint that reports are forwarded to (when using the internal forwarder feature for cross-host reporting)
- Skeleton applications have been added to test isolated application configurations
- Cleanup by @bemurphy

0.1.1
=======

Bug fix. Firefox doesn't seem to like the default-src directive, reverting back to 'allow'

0.1.0
=======
